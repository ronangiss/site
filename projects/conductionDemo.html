			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;This project was completed as part of my electronics class during the fall semester of my junior year at Tufts. The project requirement was to create an electromechanical game that included some user input using an electronic device and moving mechanical elements controlled electronically. I decided to build a small goalie robot that could rotate his arms to block shots on a soccer goal.</p>

			<h3>Final Prototype</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;After assembling the 3D printed robot parts with the servo motors, I wired together the circuit components on a breadboard and had a working prototype!</p>
