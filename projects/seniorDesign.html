			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;All mechanical engineering students at Tufts are required to complete an intensive engineering design project in their final year. In September of 2021, I joined forces with a group of four other students on a project with the general intention of building some kind of robotic plant grower system. Our advisor for this project was the owner of midsize vegetable farm in northern New Hampshire named Tim.</p>

			<h3>Problem Definition</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;We began the design process through an interview with Tim, seeking to understand what factors were important to his success as a farmer and where he encountered challenges in his daily routine. Through a thorough analysis of our initial interview with Tim, we identified three key issues he experienced on his farm:</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Producing crops throughout the year despite variable environmental conditions</b></p>
			<p>Ex: Tim suffered a devastating loss of over half his lettuce crop due to disease during a wet spell in the previous year.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Coordinating crop harvesting with market demand for those vegetables</b></p>
			<p>Ex: Methods that can increase vegetable shelf life such as better cooling and drying of harvested crops provide more flexibility in when crops can be planted and harvested.</p>
			<br>
			<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Maximizing profit by considering the profit per square foot on the farm</b></p>
			<p>Ex: Tim's farm avoids growing one and done crops like broccoli or cauliflower which take up space for long periods (~70 days) and then are worth only a small amount after being pulled from the ground.</p>

			<h3>Quality Function Deployment</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;After defining a set of problems, we began evaluating the needs of our stakeholders&mdash;farmers on small to midsize farms, like Tim&mdash;and prioritizing the relative importance of these needs. Using this list of needs, we sought to develop engineering requirements that we could include in our design that would meet these needs. A large part of this process was researching how already existing products met the needs we had identified to understand how they had translated those needs into their design and where they failed to appropriately address those needs. For example, one of the products we looked at was Farmbot&mdash;a CNC-type automated farming system. Although, fairly easy to use (user need: ease of use &#9989;), the immense size of the metal rig encompassing the planter box made this product impractical to move around on the farm and difficult to scale up (user needs: size and scalability &#10060;).</p>
