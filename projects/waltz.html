			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;This project was completed as part of my robotics class during the spring semester of my junior year at Tufts. The project requirements were to work with a partner to create a pair of waltzing robots that spun around one another in a waltz when music was played. Although my partner and I built different robots, we worked together extensively to integrate them so that they would dance well together. Below is a video that walks through our project explaining what we did, what challenges we encountered, and what we ultimately achieved.</p>
