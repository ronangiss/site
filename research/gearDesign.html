	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Before any flight tests could be conducted with a chordwise wing shifting robot, the obvious first step was to design and construct the robot. Designing the robot has been the most time intensive part of this research project so far. Having never designed a mechanical system before, I had a lot to learn a lot along the way particularly regarding constructing models in SolidWorks computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D printing plastic prototypes.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To start off the design, I sketched a highly simplified 2D model of the robot. A robot with a body and two wings that could slide chordwise along the robot's length. Although exceedingly simple, this sketch is useful in demonstrating the outwards functionality of the robot without the internal complexities that make this behavior possible.</p>

	<h3>Gear Spacing Test</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Pleased with how the design was coming together in SolidWorks, I decided it was time to begin 3D printing prototypes. The first test was to confirm whether the gear science I was using from Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design to determine how far apart to space the gears was correct. To do this, I designed a large piece to hold all the gears at the distances I'd calculated. After printing out the piece and mounting all the injection-molded gears we'd purchased off Amazon, the gear train moved smoothly. Success!</p>
