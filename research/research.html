			<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;In February of 2020, I began working with Professor Woodward&mdash;a mechanical engineering professor at Tufts&mdash;to design a flying-squirrel inspired robot. The purpose of this page is to document the research that I've completed for this project so that I can remember what I've done. It may also prove useful to anyone choosing to continue the research.</p>

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The general aim of this research is to study whether complex maneuvers can be achieved with simple control inputs by taking advantage of mechanical intelligence (the plant) rather than computational intelligence (the controller). More specifically, seeking to achieve perching behavior in a gliding robot simply by adjusting the location of the center-of-pressure (COP) relative to the center-of-mass (COM). The COP is defined as the application location of the resultant aerodynamic force during flight and the COM is defined as the application location of the resultant weight force. There are a number of different ways to shift the COP relative to the COM, but typically this is accomplished by moving the fliers wings. Flying squirrels, birds, and other airborne animals usually control their gliding flight with wing sweep motions. Not to mention that many animals also have tails which&mdash;taking advantage of a long lever arm&mdash;likely play an important role in pitch control. Some fighter jets and UAVs also employ wing sweep motions to control their flight. </p>
