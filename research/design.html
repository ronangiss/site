	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Before any flight tests could be conducted with a chordwise wing shifting robot, the obvious first step was to design and construct the robot. Designing the robot has been the most time intensive part of this research project so far. Having never designed a mechanical system before, I had a lot to learn a lot along the way particularly regarding constructing models in Solidworks computer-aided design (CAD) and 3D printing plastic prototypes.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To start off the design, I sketched a highly-simplified 2D model of the robot. A robot with a body and two wings that could slide chordwise along the robot's length. Although exceedingly simple, this sketch is useful in demonstrating the outwards functionality of the robot without the internal complexities that make this behavior possible.</p>

	<h3>First Prototype</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To begin the design in Solidworks, I decided to start off focusing on the wings&mdash;the most important structure from a flight perspective. I came up with a simple model for one half of the robot body having a forelimb and hindlimb connected to a body piece. I used dimensions for the forelimb and hindlimb structure similar to the anatomical limb measurements of the Northern Flying Squirrel. I imagined wings cound then be mounted on top of or around these limbs. This was a start. However, the more pressing question I realized was not what the wings would look like exactly but how the robot would actually do the chordwise wing shifting.</p>

	<h3>Second Prototype</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Although I didn't know it had a name at the time, the mechanical structure I wanted to transform the rotary motion of a motor into linear motion of the wings was a rack and pinion. The basic idea is that a small spur gear (the pinion) is used to drive a larger toothed rectangular piece (the rack) back and forth. This structure is quite common and taught in engineering design as the "go-to" mechanism when translating rotary motion to linear motion. I would learn about it a few weeks later in my engineering design class.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;In addition to the chordwise wing shifting ability, another important design consideration was making the robot a flexible testing rig rather than a high performing flier. The point of this robot is to study gliding flight at a level that can't be studied from animals by manipulating the robot in a controlled environment. To this end, the robot should be capable of sliding its wings across a large distance, holding the wings at different dihedral/anhedral angles, and holding wings of different shapes and sizes.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To achieve different dihedral/anhedral angles, I decided to add a block with T-slots at different angles where the wings could be slid into place. In this configuration the dihedral/anhedral angles of the wing could not be changed dynamically during flight and would instead be set before flight. Nonetheless, the effect of using different dihedral/anhedral angles could be tested over the course of many trials. To achieve dynamic adjustment of dihedral/anhedral angles is of course possible, but it would require more motors. Motors are heavy and large. Too many and the robot becomes a ballistic projectile rather than a graceful glider. One could make the argument that additional degrees of freedom (DOFs) are attainable without the use of motors such as shape memory alloy wires or some other smart actuator, but that was a rabbit hole I didn't want to go down yet.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;To design the robot to be capable of holding wings of different shapes and sizes, I added a piece with many sets of holes so that the limbs could be locked into place at different orientations and positions along the robot body. Additionally, I added telescoping arms to the end of each limb so that they could be extended when desired. Like the dihedral/anhedral angles, I intended for these DOFs to be changed manually prior to running an experiment.</p>

	<h3>Third Prototype</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Although I had decided on using the rack and pinion to translate the rotary motion of the motor to the linear motion of the wings, I wasn't sure where the motor would actually be located to make this happen. Mating the motor shaft directly to the pinion gear would result in a tall body, likely producing such significant drag that the robot would end up falling rather than gliding. Ideally, the motors&mdash;one for each wing&mdash; would be in line with the wings so that they could be contained inside a narrow compact body. To do this, I decided to use a worm on the motor shaft to drive the adjacent pinion spur gear which then drove the rack.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Another change I made was to add gearing between the rack and limb connector piece so that the dihedral/anhedral angle of the wings could be more well fine tuned than just the five different T-slots I had initially conceived. Additionally, Professor Woodward had warned me that T-slots were notoriously difficult to 3D print so that T-shaped can actually be easily moved in and out of the slots.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Having worked through a few preliminary designs and meeting with Professor Woodward to discuss them, I learned that the Solidworks animation feature is a much better way to show off designs than screenshots or simple screen recordings. After watching a few YouTube videos on making basic animations in Solidworks, I was able to put together some of my own showcasing the robot. I found that these animations were much more effective than screenshots or screen recordings at communicating my design when presenting to other people.

	<h3>Fourth Prototype</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The beauty of Solidworks is being able to quickly sketch out ideas in 3D. Whether the resulting system will perform as you expect it to is not guaranteed from a nice looking design and will depend on the manufacturing process. As I began to consider this, I was worried that I couldn't model the gearing well enough that the gears would actually mesh. It's not too difficult to make nice looking gears, but functional gear train design is a science. I explored designing and then 3D printing gears to test them with my project making a <a href="../projects/gooseAutomaton.html">goose automaton</a>. Despite having some success designing functional gear trains with the goose automaton, I decided to purchase injection-molded spur gears, racks, and worms for the robot. Not only were these gears professionally designed, but they also had much smoother surfaces compared to the gears I had 3D printed. The unique toothed piece attached to the limb connector to control the dihedral/anhedral angle would not be available commercially, so I decided to replace the wing angle adjustment mechanism with another.</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Professor Woodward recommended using a four bar linkage. This was a term I'd never heard of before, but as I would learn through some later research it is a common mechanism in engineering design used to translate rotational motion to oscillatory motion. As the name suggests, there are four bars. One is fixed (gray link in animation below), another rotates continuously (red link in animation below), another rotates and translates&mdash;general plane motion (green link in animation below), and the other rotates back and forth (blue link in animation below). Making the blue link the wing, the dihedral/anhedral angle could be adjusted using such a mechanism. Nuts and bolts would fixe the linkages in place, but their position could be manually adjusted by loosening the fasteners, moving the links to the new desired position, and then resecuring the fasteners. Furthermore, later prototypes could dynamically change the dihedral/anhedral angle during flight by connecting a motor to the red link. I explored four bar linkage design for wing movement in my project making a <a href="../projects/butterflyAutomaton.html">butterfly automaton</a> and was encouraged by my results.</p>

	<h3>Fifth Prototype</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Seeing as the rack was secured to the body by a T-shaped protuberance off the rack that fit into a T-shaped slot on the body, Professor Woodward was concerned that such a system would have too much friction and demand higher power motors than we could afford at that size scale. He recommended I instead look into some kind of bearing capture system to hold the rack in place, while still allowing it the one degree of freedom to freely slide back and forth along the robot's body. Looking into the smallest bearings I could find for sale on Amazon, I then made simplified models of these bearings in Solidworks and implemented them in a bearing capture system to hold the rack.</p>

	<h3>Sixth Prototype</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;When it came to the bearing capture system, I had initially been a little trigger happy with bearing placement, adding unnecessary weight to the robot. Additionally, the bearings on either side of the rack holding it down would be rubbing against the rack if the rack was pushed upwards. To address these issues, I reduced the overall number of bearings and replaced the bearings on either side of the rack with bearings above the rack. By replacing the bearings at the side with bearings above the rack, I was ensuring that the rack would roll against the bearings when pushed upwards at the consequence that the rack would now rub against the sides if pushed into or away from the body. This decision was made based on the assumption that the forces pushing the rack up or down&mdash;resulting from aerodynamic forces acting on the wings&mdash;would be significantly greater than the forces pushing the rack from side to side. I also added a mirror robot half to include the full robot rather than just the half I had been modeling.</p>
