	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The Eltron P310C ID card printer was yet another lucky find rejected to the junk piles of Medford. As the name suggests, the machine can be used to print identification cards for enhanced security in a variety of organizations such as schools, hospitals, and commercial businesses. Blank cards (made of PVC or a PVC based composite) are loaded into the blue card holder on the right side of the printer and a color ribbon roll is mounted on the printer interior, stretched between a pair of plastic shafts. Through a 25 pin connector and associated software driver, a computer can be interfaced with the printer to send card designs to the printer for production. Unfortunately, the printer came with neither cards, color ribbon rolls, nor connectors so I was not able to test it (for purely academic purposes of course).</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The printer applies color to the initially white cards using a thermal print head through one of two methods&mdash;dye sublimation or resin thermal transfer. In dye sublimation, the print head sublimates the color ribbon into a vapor that is then deposited on the card surface. In resin thermal transfer, the print head melts the monochrome ribbon into a liquid that is then deposited on the card surface. Resin thermal transfer printing results in much more durable prints, but limits the print color to just a single option. Both printing methods can be achieved with the Eltron P310C by loading the appropriate color ribbon roll and selecting the desired setting in the driver software.</p>

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Examining the <a href="https://cdn.barcodesinc.com/resources/EltronP310Manual.pdf">Eltron P310 manual</a>, some important information can be decoded from the part number, "P310C-OM1OP", written on the label. The "C" following the printer name indicates that the printer is designed to print in color rather than being limited to monochrome. The set of characters following the hyphen indicates that the printer is not capable of programming smart cards (with embedded chips), is capable of magnetically encoding cards, must have high coercivity (HiCo) magnetic cards loaded in with magnetic stripe side facing down, has standard memory, and uses a parallel (as opposed to serial) computer interface connection. High coercivity cards are used when the cards are expected to receive high use and possess stronger magnetic fields&mdash;measured in Oersteds for this application&mdash;than low coercivity (LoCo) cards.</p>

	<p class="label">Use Instructions Label on Interior</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The images on the label communicate instructions for the following tasks from left to right: color ribbon loading, card loading, and cleaning roller replacement. Highlighting the active pieces in blue and providing warnings in yellow while leaving the rest of the instructions in black and white was a helpful tactic for emphasizing key takeaways from the instructions and made the images fairly intuitive to read.</p>

	<p class="label">Card Printer Ribbon Label</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;When printing via dye sublimation, a YMCKO color ribbon is typically loaded into the printer. YMCKO stands for five steps in the printing process: yellow, magenta, cyan, black, and overlay. The YMCKO ribbon contains repeating sections of YMCKO panels in series. The card slides under the print head to receive a coating and is then pulled back before the print head to receive the next coating. As with paper printers, the primary colors of pigment (yellow, magenta, and cyan) can be used to create all matter of colors on the card. The final coating, the overlay, adds a clear protective layer over the card to preserve its life. Each of these layers is only a few microns thick.</p>

	<h3>Status Indicator Lights</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The status indicator lights located on the front cover of the printer are used to communicate basic status updates to the user. The adjacent blue panel button also allows the user to execute some basic functions such as clearing errors (indicated by the status lights), initiate the cleaning process, or initiate a test print.</p>
	<img src="../images/teardowns/IDprinter/exteriorLights.jpg" alt="Green, Yellow, Red LEDs for Different Printer States" class="center">
	<p class="label">Exterior View</p>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;Examining the simple one-sided PCB which holds the status indicator lights and panel button, it's clear that all the computation for these processes is directed off to a separate board to which the wires leaving the PCB are directed. Looking at the traces, it's interesting to note that the resistor only appears to be used for the green LED. Maybe the green LED has a substantially different forward voltage (voltage required to light the LED when current travels forward through the diode), than either the yellow or red LED. In addition to labelling each component, the polarity of the LEDs is labelled on the PCB to ensure proper installation where "A" stands for anode and "K" stands for cathode. I'm not sure what the purpose of the missing component labeled "CT1" would be. Possibly that component was used for a different customization of the printer and CT may have stood for "connection" or "common terminal".</p>

		<li><p>Coldfire MCF5206 Microprocessor (<a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MCF5206UM.pdf">datasheet</a>)</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;Trying to make sense of the over 400 page long datasheet was overwhelming and more than I was willing to slog through, but it provided some basic information of note. The microprocessor has 160 pins including a clock input, i2C compatible Motoral Bus (M-Bus) clock and data pins, two pairs of DUART transferring and receiving pins, interrupt control pins, timer in and out pins, chip select pins, and general purpose input/output (GPIO) pins. Computational information is stored on board in the form of cache and SRAM (static random access memory), and can also be stored off board in the form of DRAM (dynamic random access memory). Given all these capabilities, this part maybe would be more aptly named a microcontroller instead of a microprocessor.</p>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><p>ISSI IS41C16100 DRAM (<a href="https://pdf1.alldatasheet.com/datasheet-pdf/view/96737/ISSI/IS41C16100-60T.html">datasheet</a>)</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The DRAM can contain 16 MBIT (2MB) of information with an accelerated processor cycle access method called EDO Page Mode. Memory access time is an important parameter for memory units such as this one as accessing information from memory takes much longer (more processor cycles) than running tasks on the processor.</p>
		</li>
		<br>
		<li><p>ON Semiconductor HCT574A Octal Register (<a href="https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/mc74hct574a-d.pdf">datasheet</a>)</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The full name of this component in the datasheet is actually "Octal 3-State Noninverting D Flip-Flop with LSTTL-Compatible Inputs". There's a lot to unpack in that name. "Octal" indicates that the register includes eight "D Flip-Flop" circuits. The D-type flip-flop circuit is a type of circuit using several logic circuits (i.e. AND, OR, NAND, NOR) to store or latch onto a binary value (1 or 0) even when the input changes. Each flip-flop will only take in a new value during the next clock cycle triggered by a clock pin connected to the register. "3-State" indicates that the outputs can be high (1), low (0), or a high impedance state which effectively disables the output from affecting anything downstream (i.e. disconnected from output bus). This special high impedance state is triggered on all flip-flops when the output enable pin on the register is set high. "Non-inverting" means that when data is read in, the same signal is then sent out. An inverting register would flip all of the binary input data, 1s would become 0s and 0s would becomes 1s. "LSTTL" stands for Low Power Schottky Transistor-Transitor Logic and likely some modification was required to make the register compatible with this more advanced lower power transistor-transistor logic (TTL) as compared to previous forms of TTL. TTL&mdash;which includes AND, OR, NAND, and NOR logic&mdash;forms the basic foundations for all computer operations. These conditional logic gates are each composed of a pair of transistors, hence the name "transistor-transistor logic".</p>

		<li><p>Fairchild Semiconductor HC574 Octal Register (<a href="https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/74vhc574-d.pdf">datasheet</a>)</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The full name for this device is "Octal D-Type Flip-Flop with 3-STATE Outputs". Now that we know what those words mean it's not quite as scary to seem them crop up. Although the name is slightly different, I wasn't able to perceive any functional differences between this register and the previous HCT574 register from the datasheets. Fairchild Semiconductor has since been purchased by ON Semiconductor.</p>

		<li><p>Nexperia 74HC165 PISO Shift Register (<a href="https://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74HC_HCT165.pdf">datasheet</a>)</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The four shift registers&mdash;each composed of a series of 8 D-Type Flip-Flops&mdash;can feed a captured value down the cascade of Flip-Flop circuits following a clock signal. The shift registers are potentially used to expand the capability of the GPIO pins on the microprocessor to a number of devices greater than the number of GPIO pins. The shift registers make this possible by carrying in a set of digital (i.e. binary) signals in series to then be read by multiple devices in parallel on different Flip-Flop circuits of the shift register and vice versa when the devices are writing signals to the microprocessor. When chip is enabled, data is transferred from shift register to storage register to appear as an output (the shift and storage registers have independent clocks).</p>

			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The adjustable voltage regulator can be used to produce output voltages between 1.2V and 37V when controlled using a variable resistor, possibly the function of the nearby digital potentiometer.</p>

		<li><p>Analog Devices ADM202 CMOS Driver/Receiver (<a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/609/ADM202-1503026.pdf">datasheet</a>)</p>
			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The CMOS driver/receiver can transform a 5V input to a +/-10V output using a switching power supply type circuit. Given the rectangular body, parallel rows of pins mounted using through hole technology (THT) this IC can be described as a Dual In-line Package (DIP). I'm not sure why, but the name DIP somehow sounds much more friendly than IC.</p>

			<p>&emsp;&emsp;The primary function of a driver is to control a high power (high voltage and high current) supply using low power logic signals. "Push-Pull" indicates that a push-pull amplifer circuit is included in this component to raise the output current so that the driver can output high power. The functionality of the push-pull and driver circuits are founded in transistors. For example, one transistor alone could be used as a driver by opening and closing a high power line in response to a control signal. A typical application of a driver is to control motors&mdash;a high power application&mdash;using logic signals coming from a low power microcontroller or some such device. It just so happens that there are exactly four motors in this ID printer. This would lead me to believe that this four channel driver is responsible for driving those four motors.</p>

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;There are some other ICs for which I couldn't read the labels and there are lots of other components on the board like diodes, electrolytica capacitors, and connectors. Many of the ICs are dated using a similar scheme year-week scheme. For example, 0309 at the end of the microprocessor label to indicate the 9th work week of 2003 or the 0308 at the end of the HCT574A components to indicate the 8th week of 2003. Most devices on the board are also made to operate around 5V.</p>

	<h3>Entry Unit</h3>
	<p>&emsp;&emsp;The entry unit is used to control the thickness of cards permitted to enter the machine. Based on its relatively simple design which only obstructs cards that are too thick from passing, it seems like cards thinner than the desired setting would still be allowed to pass. Since this unit contains no sensor to communicate to the rest of the printer what thickness card is being inserted, it seems unlikely that the rest of the printer would be adjusting its process in any way to account for cards of different sizes. Instead, it's more likely the entry unit serves to reduce the likelihood of multiple cards being sent into the printer simulatenously which could generate unpredictable issues within the printer that might jam the system.</p>

	<p>&emsp;&emsp;With just the torsion spring holding the lint roller in place, it can be easily removed and replaced as it accumulates dust over the course of printer operation. It's interesting to note that in addition to the card cleaning rollers, the manual states that the printer also comes with cleaning cards. The cleaning cards are supposed to be fed through the printer when the printer indicates that cleaning is required by flashing the orange and red status indicator lights. The cleaning cards are pre-saturated with cleaning fluid to wipe clean the interior surfaces of the printer feed system including the print head, magnetic encoding station, and rollers.</p>
